## ***Discussion Points During a Demo - Chapter 1***

Fortinet provides a large library of infrastructure as code (IaC) templates to deploy baseline and iterate POC and production environments in public cloud.  IaC support includes Terraform, Ansible, and cloud-specific services such as Azure ARM, AWS Cloudformation, and Google Deployment templates. Terraform Providers are available for several Fortinet products to insert and iterate running configuration.

### Key questions during your demo - Chapter 1

When giving this TEC Workshop as as demo, the following questions will provide a basis for next steps and future meetings:

* Has your organization standardized on an IaC tool-set for infrastructure provisioning and iteration?
* How are the responsibilities for infrastructure assigned?  Does cloud network fall under a DevOps, Cloud Networking, or Application Delivery team, as examples?
* What is view on how IaC can improve workflows?
* Is workflow automation in cloud and cross-organizational collaboration important within your cloud business?
