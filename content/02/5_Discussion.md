## ***Discussion Points During a Demo - Chapter 2***

When discussing Azure Automation with the Customer it is important to point out

* Azure Automation Runbooks can be used to provide automation capability with Azure Environments, The Runbooks can be run manually, on a schedule, or via a webhook.
* Azure Automation Identity can be assigned one or more Azure Roles to one or more Azure Scopes.
* Azure Automation Runbooks can be written in PowerShell and Python.

Azure Automation Runbooks can be triggered via a FortiGate Automation Stitch, the Action of the FortiGate Automation Stitch can be a Webhook used to send information from a FortiGate to an Azure Automation Runbook.

Utilizing the FortiGate Azure SDN Connector the FortiGate can react to events in the Azure Environment and trigger actions in the Azure environment.

The FortiGate Azure SDN Connector enables the FortiGate to be dynamically aware of the Azure environment, combine that awareness with Azure Automation Runbooks and there are infinite possibilities for Security issue detection, remediation, and so much more.
